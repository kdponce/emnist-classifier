This is a basic EMNIST Letters Classifier that I made with the primary goal of identifying the effect
of each layer type in a CNN model to the evaluation accuracy and loss. It is a tutorial project of
sorts with the purpose of allowing me to gain an in-depth understanding of the topics that I have 
mostly glazed over during my implementation of another project, a facial expression recognizer using a modified VGG16 network.

Planning to host a live version soon.
